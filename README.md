# CacheChat-v2

Chat about your data, production-grade style.

## Notes

- You don't need to upload anything to chat. It just helps the AI out, and who doesn't want to do that?
- You can upload as many files/URLs as you want at any point in the conversation.
- A list of accepted file/URL file formats can be found [here](https://textract.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#currently-supporting). Keep in mind that it sometimes won't be able to extract the text from the file (a blurry image for example).
- Once a file/URL is uploaded, it can be removed by clicking the "remove" button.
