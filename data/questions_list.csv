"What is the most effective way to do scalable real-time inference of custom models in AWS? Specifically, between using Lambda to call a model hosted on SageMaker or calling an ELB that routes to an autoscaling ECS service hosted on Fargate?",
Which feature store solutions offer feature versioning? Can AWS Sagemaker FS offer feature versioning? How does SMFS eliminate the need for Glue jobs?,
"Is there a link provided for virtual workshops in the mlops world conference? If so, where can it be found?",
"What MLOps technologies and projects would be recommended for deploying PyTorch models to Kubernetes containers for non-trivial orchestration needs involving monitoring drift, automatic retraining, data validation, and model and data versioning? Additionally, what distributed training tools and orchestration and DAG tools would pair well with Seldon if automation of its deployment is desired?",
"What are some examples of effective data wrangling to model building pipelines for NLP preprocessing of clinical notes, cleaning/standardizing structured data, and training patient-level embeddings for downstream tasks?",
What is the most common language used for developing computer vision models and how does deployment on edge devices or cloud affect the choice of language?,
"What tools are available for data observability, monitoring drift in predictions, and overall data health before consumption into a feature store and/or models?",
"When prototyping infrastructure on multiple local machines, should one use docker containers or VMs?",
"What are some recommendations for a small team trying to implement MLOps, specifically around toolset, Python programming, CI/deployment, project scaffolding, documentation, project registry, data exploration/preparation, tests, feature store, data versioning, experimenting, and training?",
How can data mesh and feature stores coexist? Should there be a centralized team to maintain a feature store with multiple data products or should a data product use a feature store and serve the online and historical data as different ways of consuming the features?,
"What is the best method to use for deployment in MLOps, MLflow + Seldon or Kubeflow? And can MLflow and Kubeflow or Seldon be used together for deployment?",
